    Pinch Points
</p>
<p style="color: whitesmoke;">
    A pinch point is the layout of the land between two high points of the terrain that create a bottleneck toward a certain location. These are considered prime locations for hunters to set up an ambush because they concentrate deer travel into predictable spots.

<p style="color: whitesmoke;">
    Forces Movement: Deer, naturally seeking the path of least resistance while still feeling secure, are "pinched" into using a smaller, more confined space to travel between key areas like bedding, feeding, and watering locations.
</p>
<p style="color: whitesmoke;">
    Predictable Travel: Because deer movement is restricted to a small area, hunters have a higher chance of a deer passing within range of their stand or blind.
</p>
<p style="color: whitesmoke;">
    Effective Year-round: While often targeted during the rut when bucks are actively cruising for does, well-chosen pinch points can be effective throughout the entire season, especially if they connect a bedding area and a food source.

    Ridges
</p>
<p style="color: whitesmoke;">
    A ridge is an elevated spine of land that deer use as a natural travel corridor, bedding area, and a strategic point to utilize wind and thermals to their advantage. Hunting ridges effectively requires understanding how specific features within the ridge system influence deer movement.

    Benches
</p>
<p style="color: whitesmoke;">
    These are flat, shelf-like areas along the side of a ridge that provide easier travel for deer than the steep slopes. They often connect bedding areas to food sources and are excellent spots to place a stand.
